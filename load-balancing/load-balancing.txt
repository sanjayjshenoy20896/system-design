Server:
It is a system that serves a request.

Load balancing
Concept of actually having n servers and balaning the load across the n servers is load balancing.


Consistant hashing:
When user sends a requests, a unique request id is generated and this request id(Uniformly random) is then sent to the server.
When can hash the request id as h(r1) ->m1 

How to decide which server gets a reuest
m1/n -> N is number of servers, The reminder is the server the request is sent to
As the hashing function is contents, the module operation can retrun the same value leading to resource issue.

Therefor the hasing mechanism has to altered to accomdate the edge cases.

Load factor -> it is the reciprocal of number of servers
