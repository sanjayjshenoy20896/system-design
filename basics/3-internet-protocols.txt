What are HTTP and HTTPS protocols?
These are basically that are used to communicate over the internet.
They are 2 basic ways:
1.)HTTP -> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
2.)HTTPS -> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol 

HTTP:
It is the standard protocol used by web browsers and servers to communicate and exchange data.

Main features:
HTTP operates on port 80 by default.
It transfers data in plain text, meaning the content is not protected.
Because it is unencrypted, attackers can intercept or modify the data easily.
It is still used for non-sensitive websites where security is not a concern (like public blogs or info pages).

Advantages:
1.) Simplicity
2.) Speed
3.) Compatibility

Disadvantages:
1.) No security
2.) No User trust
3.) Not suitable for Sensitive data

HTTPS:
It is an extension of HTTP with added security through encryption.

Main features:
HTTPS operates on port 443 by default.
It uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data.
Even if attackers capture the traffic, they cannot read the actual message.
Browsers show a padlock symbol next to the URL to indicate that the site is secure.

Advantages:
Data encryption
User trust
SEO benefits
Prevents data tempering
Supports modern browsers

Disadvantages:
Cost of certifications
Performance overhead
Setup Complexity

Why HTTPS over HTTP?
Data security
User trust
Protection from hackers
Better search engine hacking
Compliance with standards
Improved performance
