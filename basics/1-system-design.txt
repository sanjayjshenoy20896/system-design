System design:
Systems design is the use of computer engineering principles to build large scale distributed systems.
It involves converting business problems and requirements into technical solutions.

Vertical Scaling
optimise processes by increasing throughput within the same resource.

Preprocessing usingcron job:
Prepare resource handling before hand.

Back up servers:
Have a additional server in back up to maintain system resilliance.
Have backup and avoid single point of failure.

Vertical Scaling:
Have multiple server in place to handle maximum performance.

Microservices Architecture:
Splitting up of difference parts of the system into single individual services.

Distributes systems: (partitioning)
It is a network of independent computers (nodes) that work together, communicate over a network, and share resources to appear as a single, unified system to users

Load Balancing:
Its a central point that is used to route the request based on user location or server availability

Decoupling:
Seperation of concerns to deliver optimal performance.
It allows part of the system to work independently and completly isolated from one other.
It helps in fostering agility,independent deployments and easier integration.

Logging and metric calculation:
They have 4 main parts:
1.) Analytics
2.) Auditing
3.) Reporting
4.) Machine Learning

Extensibility:


Main problems for scalability:
1.) Order overload
2.) Complexity
3.) Mishaps
4.) recruitment
5.) Fault Tolerance
6.) Seperation of concerns


Low Level design:
it focusses on how one codes these High Level design into services.
