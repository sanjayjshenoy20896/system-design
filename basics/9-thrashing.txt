Thrashing:
when a process spends more time in paging (swapping pages in and out of memory) than executing instructions. 

This causes frequent page faults, long queues for the paging device, and further decreases in CPU utilization.

As the CPU scheduler tries to compensate by adding even more processes, the system enters a cycle of continuous paging, known as thrashing.

Cause of Thrashing
High degree of multiprogramming exceeds available memory frames.
Processes frequently request pages not in memory, causing page faults.
Excessive paging reduces CPU execution time and overall system throughput.
New processes steal memory frames from existing processes, increasing page faults further.

Minimizing Thrashing
Local Replacement: Prevents one process from stealing frames from another, reducing cascading page faults.
Working Set Strategy: Ensures each process gets enough frames to hold its active pages, maximizing CPU utilization while minimizing thrashing.
