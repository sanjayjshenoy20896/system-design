Cache:
Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located near the CPU, designed to store recently accessed instructions and data.
The primary function of cache is to improve system performance by reducing the time required to access frequently used data and instructions.
These are directly fecthed from the CPU memory helps in performance.

Cache Memory:
Cache memory is a small, fast memory unit that holds copies of the data and instructions that are frequently accessed by the CPU.
By storing recently used data, the cache reduces the time it takes for the CPU to retrieve instructions and data, thereby enhancing performance.


Cache hit vs Cache Miss:
If the requested data is found in the cache, it's called a Cache Hit.
If the data is not found, it's called a Cache Miss

Cache Organization and Memory Hierarchy
Cache memory operates by transferring a block of elements from the main memory to the cache memory.
This helps in reducing access time and improving performance.


The goal is to place frequently accessed data in the cache so the CPU can quickly retrieve it, minimizing the time spent on memory accesses.

Locality of Reference
The underlying principle of cache memory is the locality of reference, which can be divided into two types:

Spatial Locality: 
Refers to the tendency of the CPU to access adjacent memory locations. If a program accesses a memory location, it is likely to access neighboring locations in the near future.

Temporal Locality: 
Refers to the tendency of the CPU to repeatedly access the same memory locations within a short time period. This indicates that recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again soon.

Cache Performance and Hit Ratio
Hit Ratio = (Number of Hits) / (Total Accesses) = hits / (hits + misses)

A higher hit ratio means that the CPU is retrieving data more frequently from the cache, leading to better performance. Several factors can improve cache performance:

Increasing the cache block size
Using higher cache associativity
Reducing the miss rate
Reducing the miss penalty (the time taken to fetch data from main memory after a cache miss)
Reducing the time to hit the cache
