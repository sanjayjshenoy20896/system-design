Program:
A passive entity consisting of a set of instructions stored on disk (e.g., an executable file). 
It does not perform any action by itself.

Process: 
An active instance of a program in execution, having its own memory, registers, and resources managed by the OS.

Thread:
The smallest unit of execution within a process that shares resources like memory and files with other threads of the same process.

Characteristics

Program:
It is static and passive, stored on disk in binary or executable format
A program does not consume CPU or memory until it is loaded into memory and executed.
Multiple threads can execute the same program.

Process:
It is dynamic and active, with its own memory space, stack, and registers.
They are isolated from one another.
Switching between processes requires saving and restoring their entire state.

Thread
lightweight and exist within a process.
They share the same code, data, and file resources but have their own stack and program counter.
Thread creation and switching are faster compared to processes, making them suitable for tasks like real-time updates, parallel computations, or handling multiple client requests in servers.

Types
Programs: System programs, Application programs, Utility programs.
Processes: Independent processes, Cooperating processes.
Threads: User-level threads, Kernel-level threads, Hybrid threads.
