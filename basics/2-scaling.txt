How systems interact:
When the user sends a request to a server. The server then cosumes the request and performs some operations and returns a response back to the user.
The above process is described as an Application Programmer Interface (API).

Scaling system design:
It is a network of independent computers (nodes) that work together, communicate over a network, and share resources to appear as a single, unified system to users

There are of 2 types
1.) Horizontal Scaling ->  Adding more machines to deal with increasing requirements
a.) Requires load balancing
b.) resilient
c.) Network based communications (RPC)
d.) Data inconsistancy
e.) Scaling based on user demand
2.) Vertical Scaling -> Replacing the current machines with more advanced machines to improve throughput and hence response time.
a.) Single point of failure
b.) Inter process communications
c.) Data consistancy
d.) Hardware limitations

Using cloud solutions:
It is a set of severs that are running on the cloud. We use this servers to control our services
